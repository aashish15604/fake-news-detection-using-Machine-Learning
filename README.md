# Fake-news-detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project classifies news articles as Fake or Real using machine learning. Text data is cleaned and converted into numerical features using TF-IDF. A Logistic Regression model is trained to perform classification and achieves high accuracy, showing effective fake news detection.

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:
